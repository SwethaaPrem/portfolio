<h2>About <span class="highlight">Me</span></h2>

<div class="about-text">
<p>
I am <span class="highlight">Swethaa Premnath</span>, a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong interest in designing clean, user-friendly, and visually appealing websites. I enjoy working with <span class="highlight">HTML</span> and <span class="highlight">CSS</span> to build responsive and well-structured web pages that provide a smooth experience for users.
</p>

<p>
I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my technical skills. I believe that a good website is not only about how it looks but also about how effectively it communicates information and serves its users. Through my projects, I strive to combine creativity with functionality to deliver meaningful digital experiences.
</p>

<p>
Apart from web development, I enjoy exploring new tools, learning about emerging technologies, and continuously upgrading my knowledge. I am motivated, detail-oriented, and committed to growing as a professional in the field of technology and software development.
